  <meta name="description" content="Hello again! My name is Daniel Nziranziza, and I enjoy creating new
  things with computer programs. Since I was a child, I have always
  loved exploring electronic devices, especially mobile phones and
  computers. After realizing my strong interest, I decided to pursue
  Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science in high school. In 2018,
  Andela opened a pan-African hub in Kigali, and I was among the first
  cohort. Andela gave me a chance to get my hands dirty with code and
  opened me to the world of world-class software development." />
